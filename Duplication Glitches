0.4.0

- Using the half door illegal trick possible in possible in 0.2 (By placing a door next to a cactus you will get a half door.) it can still be done in 0.4 but will drop a door when done. You can either place a block under it to update it to get the second door or an easier way is to do it in water and it automatically updates and you don't lose a block in the process. This glitch is also possible in 0.3.0 however, you will not get the cactus back.
